# SubTrackr-App-Capstone

- I created and built a Flask-based web application called SubTrackr. It is a web application that allows users to store their monthly/annual subscriptions to the app with its main purpose to enable users to view all their subscriptions and memberships on a single screen, it allows users to stay informed about upcoming dues and make timely payments to avoid late fees and overdrafts.
- I built a website framework with Flask and wrote Python script to create forms, routes and models.
- I used  a SQLAlchemy database in Flask to store, create and delete user data and post inventory.
- I constructed the website layout using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to give each page a uniform & branded look.
- Retrieved data via jinja. I used the template engine, Jinja, to retrieve data and to create HTML formats that are returned to the user via an HTTP response.
- Incorporated user authentication and authorization with Flask-Login.
- Future Plans: Modify the functionality to be able to unsubscribe directly to the application without leaving the website and create a mobile app operable by android and apple.
